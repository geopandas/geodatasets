# Data backup

If the dataset exposed via `geodatasets` is no longer available on the original site but
can be retrieved (e.g. from local cache), if the conditions permit, we can store it in
this folder and link to the Github URL to minimise breakage. However, this should be
only an extremely rare solution.
